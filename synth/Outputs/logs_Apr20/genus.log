Sequential clock pins without clock waveform

The following sequential clock pins have no clock waveform driving them in mode 
'bcwc'.  No timing constraints will be derived for paths leading to or from     
these pins.

Timing exceptions with no effect

The following timing exceptions are not currently affecting timing in the       
design in mode 'bcwc'.  Either no paths in the design satisfy the exception's   
path specification, or all paths that satisfy the path specification also       
satisfy an exception with a higher priority.  You can improve runtime and       
memory usage by removing these exceptions if they are not truly needed.  To see 
if there is a path in the design that satisfies the path specification for an   
exception, or to see what other exception is overriding an exception because of 
priority, use the command:                                                      
  report timing -paths [eval [::legacy::get_attribute paths <exception>]]

new external delays.

Scan mapping status report
==========================
    Scan mapping: converting flip-flops that pass TDRC.
    Scan mapping: bypassed.  You have to either 1) set attribute 'dft_scan_map_mode' to 'tdrc_pass' and run 'check_dft_rules' or 2) set attribute 'dft_scan_map_mode' to 'force_all'.

    Scan mapping bypassed because no TDRC data is available: either command 'check_dft_rules' has not been run or TDRC data has been subsequently invalidated.
