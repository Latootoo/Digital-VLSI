  1 Warning CDFG-217    Signal or variable has multiple drivers and no     
                        loads. This may cause verification mismatches      
                        between the original and synthesized designs.      
                        Verify that the drivers of this signal are         
                        correct.                                           
 10 Warning CDFG-360    Referenced signal not in sensitivity list.  This   
                        may cause simulation mismatches between the        
                        original and synthesized designs.                  
 22   Info  CDFG-372    Bitwidth mismatch in assignment.                   
  3 Warning CDFG-419    Only a net expression may be connected to an       
                        output or inout port.                              
                        In standard Verilog, only a net, or a bit-select,  
                        part-select, or concatenation of nets may be       
                        connected to the output or inout port of a module  
                        instance.  Connecting a reg will result in a       
                        simulation error.  This restriction does not       
                        exist in SystemVerilog.                            
  1 Warning CDFG-428    Creating blackbox.                                 
                        Blackboxes are represented as unresolved           
                        references in the design. Use

                        found.                                             
  2 Warning CDFG-468    Output port is wider than connected signal.        
                        This may cause simulation mismatches between the   
                        original and synthesized designs.

                        issue an error when a latch is inferred. Use       
                        'set_attribute hdl_latch_keep_feedback true' to    
                        infer combinational logic rather than a latch

 23 Warning TIM-11      Possible timing problems have been detected in     
                        this design.                                       
                        Use 'report timing -lint' for more information.    
  2 Warning TUI-273     Black-boxes are represented as unresolved          
                        references in the design.                          
                        To resolve the reference, either load a            
                        technology library containing the cell by          
                        appending to the 'library' attribute, or read in   
                        the hdl file containing the module before          
                        performing elaboration. As the design is           
                        incomplete, synthesis results may not correspond   
                        to the entire design.                              
  2  Error  TUI-33      A flagged command option was incorrectly repeated. 
                        Check the command usage and correct the input to   
                        the command.                                       
  2  Error  TUI-61      A required object parameter could not be found.    
                        Check to make sure that the object exists and is   
                        of the correct type.  The 'what_is' command can    
                        be used to determine the type of an object.

                        The use of 'Conformal LEC15.1-p100' or later       
                        builds is recommended to get better verification   
                        results.
