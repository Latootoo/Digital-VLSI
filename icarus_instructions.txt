If you want to run behavioral RTL simulations on your own computer,
it's very easy! 

Install the icarus verilog compiler (available for windows, mac, and
linux, but may be a pain to install on windows and use with the
provided makefile.)


After that, you can just run make SIM=icarus, and all the testbenches
should be run using the icarus verilog compiler (checkout Makefile and
rtl/Makefile if you're curious about what's actually being run).

Waveforms for icarus will be saved as <filename>.vcd. These should be
viewable in any waveform viewer, for instance, gtkwave is an open
source one which can be installed easily on mac/linux.
