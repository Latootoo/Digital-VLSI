How to simulate and view waveforms without repeatedly opening and
closing SimVision:

(1) add the following lines to the initial begin block in your
    testbench:

      $shm_open("<name of your testbench>.shm");
      $shm_probe("ASCM"); 

This will tell the simulator to save all of your waveforms in a
database file.

(2) Run the compiler and simulator using the ncverilog command:
    ncverilog <tb_name>.v

    (or just run "make" if you're in the hw-transmitter directory).
        
    You should see some terminal output but no gui should appear.
    There should be a directory called <tb_name>.shm which contains
    the database files which you will load with simvision.

    (if you use the makefile, it will be in the build_<tbname>
    directory).

(3) Open simvision (type simvision in another terminal), and click the
    top-left most icon (under the file dropdown menu), "open SST2
    Database". Navigate to the <tb_name>.shm directory and select the
    .trn file.

(5) Your design should appear in the design browser. Right click it
    and select send to waveform veiwer, as usual.

(6) Now, make a change to your verilog module, re-compile and simulate
    with ncverilog.

(7) In simvision, right-click on the top-level folder in the design
    browser and select "reload". Your waveforms should be updated!


Since it takes up to 10 seconds to restart simvision, and the
simulator without the gui runs quite fast, the time savings should add
up quickly.
